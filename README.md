# Frontend-challenge
<p>This project is for the Front End Fundamentals section as part of my Bloc Apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The project is written in HTML5 and CSS with included images. I use reset.css before styling the provided data with my previous designs.</p>

# Difficulties encountered
<ul>
  <li>The requirements to start with were very vague. Only after starting the coding process did I find out that the client was interested in coding it as a list (with ul and li elements). Although this was not hard to change, it did set me back and slow me down.</li>
  <li>Additionally, organizing the css file was not easy. I found myself writing redundant CSS code, and constantly had to backtrack to clean up/consolidate classes</li>
  <li>I still don't have a full grasp of the width: x% idea with the box-sizing:border-box; setting. Although it is easier than the default box-sizing: content-box, I had to guess at %s less do math on the width %s when there were images also floated on the same line. Setting width: x% for images would just widen the image instead of adding width to the element. One way to fix this would probably be to contain the img in a div or figure as a workaround to get all math working correctly. </li>
  <li>Another challenge and learning point was changing the design after starting to code. In a real-client scenario, I would probably give them an A and B option, then refine whichever they choose before sitting down to code + agreeing that more changes to the design would add time.</li>
  <li>In conjunction with the previous point, I had trouble organizing the information, unsure if the way it was given was the way it should be ordered, or if I had any creative freedom to what made best sense.</li>
  <li>One last stupid mistake I made was not saving the bus icons all the same size causing the floated elements to exceed 100% width. Just about tore my hair out trying to figure out what was wrong :D.</li>
</ul>
